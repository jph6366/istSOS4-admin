## Synopsis
This project aims to develop a web-based administration interface for istSOS, making it easier to manage and monitor SensorThings API components. The interface will provide a user-friendly way to register, for example, new Sensors and Things, set metadata, and monitor sensor metrics such as received data, transmission delays, and overall system health.

### Benefits to the Community
Simplified Sensor Management: Users will be able to register, update, and manage SensorThings API components through an intuitive web interface.
Improved Monitoring & Control: The interface will offer real-time insights into sensor performance, data reception status, and potential transmission delays.
Enhanced Usability: Eliminates the need for complex API interactions, making istSOS more accessible to researchers, engineers, and IoT enthusiasts.

### Deliverables
A fully functional web UI for managing istSOS SensorThings components.
Features for SensrThingsAPI entities (sensor, things, etc.) registration, metadata configuration, and system status monitoring.
Visual analytics on sensor data reception, delays, and health status.
Comprehensive documentation and user guides for easy adoption.

## Why This Matters?
Currently, managing istSOS SensorThings API components requires manual API interactions. This project will provide a more intuitive and efficient way to administer istSOS instances, making sensor registration and monitoring more accessible and user-friendly for a broader audience.
